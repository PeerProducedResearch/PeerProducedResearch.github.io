Over the last days we have released two new preprints on *MedRxiv*: The first one is about the
[creation of the *Quantified Flu* project](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.10.21252242v1), which was designed and implemented collaboratively with members of the *Open Humans* and *Quantified Self* communities and highlights both the co-design process as well as the benefits of this approach.

The second preprint is a collaboration with the [*Interaction Data Lab*](https://interactiondatalab.com/) and [*Just One Giant Lab*](https://jogl.io/) and describes how the open innovation [*Co-Immune* program](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.29.20248781v1) was implemented and how teams tried to address issues around access to vaccines and vaccination hesitancy.
