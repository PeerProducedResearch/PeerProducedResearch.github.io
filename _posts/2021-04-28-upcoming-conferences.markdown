The conference season is starting up again. And as all events are remote these days due the pandemic, participating is as easy as joining a call. Some of our team members are giving talks at different conferences within the next few weeks: <br/>Bastian is presenting what we learned with *Quantified Flu* at [*csv,conf,v6*](csvconf.com/) on May 4 and will talk about how *Open Humans*
implements infrastructure for citizen science at [*Data Justice*](https://datajusticelab.org/data-justice-2020/) on May 20. <br/>Enric will present his work on the motivations of personal science practitioners at the [*Science & Technology Studies Italia* conference](http://www.stsitalia.org/?lang=en) at the end June.
