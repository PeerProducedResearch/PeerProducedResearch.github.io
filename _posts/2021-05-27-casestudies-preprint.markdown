We have just released a new preprint on *SocArXiv*: 
**Kloppenborg, K.**, **Ball, M. P.**, & **Greshake Tzovaras, B.** (2021, May 23). Peer Production Practices: Design Strategies in Online Citizen Science Platforms. [https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rw58y](https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rw58y)

In this article, we inspect three online citizen science platforms - iNaturalist, Public Lab and Zooniverse - from a peer production perspective, making use of a working model of peer production focused on web design. 

In doing so, we address two questions:
- _"To what extent does knowledge production on these platforms follow peer production principles?"_ and
- _"Which mechanisms and features do these platforms use to facilitate the peer production of knowledge in practice?"_

We hope to give insights on the aptness and current implementation of peer production elemens in citizen science, as well as
to provide orientation and guidance for citizen science practicioners who are interested in increasing the level of participation 
in their projects, to reflect on whether a peer production approach would be suitable for their case and to give examples on how 
this approach could look like in practice.
