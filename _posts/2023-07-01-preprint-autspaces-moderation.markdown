Together with the larger AutSPACEs team and community, our team member Bastian has co-authored a preprint on [How to co-create content moderation policies: The case of the AutSPACEs project](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/c2xe7) that is now available on _SocArXiv_. 

AutSPACEs is a citizen science project aimed at collecting qualitative data on sensory processing in autism. As the project aims to enable participants to optionally publish their experiences on the website, a content moderation strategy was needed. And given the strong values on ethical co-design, these content moderation guidelines were co-developed between researchers and autistic volunteer participants. 

The manuscript outlines both how this co-creation process was facilitated and implemented â€“ but also highlights how this process helped to uncover community-specific moderation dilemmas and how they were addressed.
