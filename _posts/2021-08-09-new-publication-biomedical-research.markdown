Our latest publication - [_Empowering grassroots innovation to accelerate biomedical research_](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001349) â€“ is out now as a perspective article [in PLOS Biology](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001349). The result of a collaboration with fellow researchers [at CRI](https://research.cri-paris.org), Hackuarium in Lausanne and the Centre for Health Ethics Law and Development in Toronto; it is one of the winning essays of the _[Reimagine Biomedical Research for a Healthier Future Essay Challenge](https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/12/reimagine-biomedical-research-for-a-healthier-future/)_ that was launched by the _[Health Research Alliance](https://www.healthra.org/)_ & _PLOS_.

We argue that one of problems with how biomedical research is being conducted today is its hierarchical and closed structure, leading to a slow pace of innovation and research that often does not serve the needs of society. In contrast, bottom-up and open innovation communities (such as DIYBio, Fablabs and patient-led research teams) have the potential to overcome many of these problems.
<br/><br/>
Unfortunately, these initiatives remain the exception from the rule due to a lack of systemic support for them. To address these short-comings we propose three actionable reforms that could support grassroots innovation in biomedicine, which revolve about improving access to:
1. hardware, lab equipment, and consumables
2. funding routes for grassroots research movements
3. ethical oversight
