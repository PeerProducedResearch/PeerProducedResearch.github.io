The [crowdfunding campaign](https://en.goteo.org/project/transbiome) for our *Transbiome* study just ended tonight with a resounding success: **Thanks to 214 contributors we managed to raise nearly 9,000 â‚¬ â€“ 209% of our initial funding goal**!

Thanks to all of these contributions we will be able to fully implement our study plan, which is to sequence the fungal and bacterial neovaginal microbiome of 50 trans women. During the campaign we have already taken the first steps to that end. We have already:

- enrolled nearly 50 participants
- shipped out 45 sampling kits so far ðŸ“¤
- received 23 samples back at our offices ðŸ“¥
- 13 of these samples arrived at the sequencing facility ðŸ§¬

In the next days we will send out more samples, more sampling kits and also get started on preparing the crowdfunding contributor rewards!
