Our amazing Master student Clara Lehenaff has designed a community-based participatory research study to improve gynecological care for trans women. With [*Transbiome*](https://en.goteo.org/project/transbiome) she is exploring the microbial diversity of the neovaginal microbiome to perform the basic research that is necessary to understand how to treat neovaginal infections. <br/><br/>The [crowdfunding campaign for her study is going extremely well](https://en.goteo.org/project/transbiome): With more than 2 weeks to go we are already at over 80% of the optimal funding goal. **Please consider contributing to the campaign to help us make the study happen!**
