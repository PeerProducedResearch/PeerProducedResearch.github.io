The publication [_"One button in my pocket instead of the smartphone": A methodological assemblage connecting self-research and autoethnography in a digital disengagement study_](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/20597991231161093) by team members Enric & Bastian has now been published in _Methodological Innovations_.

It describes how a small, open-source based hardware device can be turned into a _one-button tracker_ to record when & for how long it was pressed. As a very versatile intervention, it can be used to create an assemblage that bridges "personal science" or "self-research" with autoethnography. Beyond describing the wider method, the manuscript also presents Enric's first-hand experience using the device for a digital disengagement study.
