Our paper describing *Quantified Flu* is [now out in a peer-reviewed version in the _Journal of Medical Internet Research_](https://www.jmir.org/2021/9/e28116/). Our main finding is that a community-driven open source approach can not only rapidly create a working tool to support individuals in learning from their own data, but also leads to a tool that's particularly well-adapted to community needs â€“ leading to a high level of continued usage that is untypical for mobile health applications.
