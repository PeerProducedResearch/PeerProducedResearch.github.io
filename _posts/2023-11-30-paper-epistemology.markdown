The publication [An epistemology for democratic citizen science](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsos.231100) to which our team members Enric & Bastian contributed to was now published in the journal *Royal Society Open Science*.

The paper outlines how democratic citizen science requires an alternative theory of knowledge, focusing on the role of diversity in the process of discovery. In particular it looks at how such an approach can offer a way to shift from an industrial to an ecological vision of how scientific research should be done and assessed.
