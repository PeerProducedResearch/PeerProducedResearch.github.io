We are happy to share a new publication - [_Contours of citizen science: a vignette study_](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.202108) – in which we have been involved and that just came out today in the journal _Royal Society Open Science_. This study explores which activities are and are not considered to be citizen science and makes use of a vignette-based survey approach in which over 300 participants were asked to rate whether they would use the term citizen science for a given, fictional project description. Using this empirical data we find that there is a plurality of understanding of what citizen science is that depends on a variety of factors. This work was part of the _EU Citizen Science_ project and is the result of a wide and international collaboration of over 25 authors from across Europe.
