To start of with the big news that we forgot to properly celebrate here: Our lab member Katharina successfully defended her PhD in November 2023! ðŸŽ‰ And a big chunk of her work is now also written up as a manuscript that is now available as a preprint under the title [_Co-Designing a wiki-based community knowledge management system for personal science_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09799). 

The manuscript outlines how a combination of design thinking and co-design strategies were used to create a digital knowledge base for the _Personal Science_ community, embodied in the _Personal Science Wiki_. This platform, based on (Semantic) MediaWiki provides a peer-produced resource for Personal Science, to generate a growing body of knowledge. Beyond the initial design and implementation, the manuscript also outlines how a user study was run to improve the accessibility & findability of knowledge!
