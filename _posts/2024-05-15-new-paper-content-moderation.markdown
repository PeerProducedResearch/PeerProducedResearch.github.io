The large team effort that was writing up the co-creation work we did for the content moderation guidelines of the [_AutSPACEs_ citizen science project](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs/) have [now been published in _Data & Policy_](https://doi.org/10.1017/dap.2024.21)!

The goal of the work was to enable participants to publicly share their own sensory processing experiences, but doing so in a safe way, thus the need for a bespoke content moderation strategy. The manuscript outlines the co-creation process (how it was facilitated), the outcomes of this process, and also how others can learn from it and use similar approaches for their own work.
