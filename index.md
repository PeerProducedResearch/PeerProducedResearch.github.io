# Welcome to the *Peer-Produced Research* Lab

    The internet has enabled novel methods of producing and sharing knowledge  that weren’t unthinkable just a few years ago. This kind of <b>distributed knowledge co-creation</b> has been coined commons-based peer production and applies to projects like open source and Wikipedia. In the <i>Peer-Produced Research Lab</i> – situated at <a href='https://cri-paris.org/en'>Center for Research & interdisciplinarity</a> (Université de Paris, Inserm U1284) in Paris – we are studying how this kind of co-creation can be used and applied to the growing field of <b>citizen & community science</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
    We have a particular interest in how individuals who engage in <b>Personal Science</b> – using empirical methods to answer questions related to their own lifes – can be scaled up to be implemented in larger groups. To achieve this we work closely with and within the <i><a href='https://www.openhumans.org'>Open Humans Foundation</a></i>, a nonprofit community and digital platform focused on personal data and citizen science. We address our research questions through an <b>interdisciplinary approach</b> that brings together methods from the social sciences, digital sciences and the field of human computer interaction.

    <p>
      We are working on a <b>broad spectrum of topics</b>: Current projects include qualitative and quantitative studies about the motivations, learning processes and barriers of personal science practitioners; user-centric design approaches and studies to improve digital citizen science tools and platforms; and facilitating a number of co-created citizen science projects. Furthermore, we are studying related issues, such as data governance and open science in citizen science settings.
    </p>
    <p>
     Importantly, many of our projects are not limited to the creation of new academic knowledge. Beyond this, we are <b>dedicated to empowering individual personal science practitioners and communities</b> by offering support to participant-led research projects and creating digital tools for them.

  <h2>Get Involved</h2>
  <div class='col-sm-9'>
    <p>
      True to the name of our lab we understand ourselves as a <b>community of peers</b> that support each other and are <b>always happy to explore new projects and collaborations</b>, regardless of if you are an academic researcher, a personal science practitioner or a community thinking about starting a participant-led research project.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are also helping to host <b>regular meetings to help people who are interested in doing self-research</b>. Last but not least, we are of course always happy to welcome student interns in our lab as well.
