## About
The internet has enabled novel methods of producing and sharing knowledge  that weren’t unthinkable just a few years ago. This kind of **distributed knowledge co-creation** has been coined commons-based peer production and applies to projects like open source and Wikipedia. In the *Peer-Produced Research Lab* – situated at [Center for Research & interdisciplinarity](https://cri-paris.org/en) (Université de Paris, Inserm U1284) in Paris – we are studying how this kind of co-creation can be used and applied to the growing field of **citizen & community science**.

We have a particular interest in how individuals who engage in ***Personal Science*** – using empirical methods to answer questions related to their own lifes – can be scaled up to be implemented in larger groups. To achieve this we work closely with and within the Open Humans Foundation, a nonprofit community and digital platform focused on personal data and citizen science. We address our research questions through an interdisciplinary approach that brings together methods from the social sciences, digital sciences and the field of human computer interaction. 


## Our Projects
Our current projects cover a broad spectrum of topics including understanding the motivations and learning processes between personal science practitioners; user-centered design approaches for citizen science tools and doing participant-led studies. Check out our list of projects we are currently working on [(more...)](/projects).


## Get Involved
There are many ways to get involved with us and we are always open to new collaborations. We are also running regular meetings to help people who are already doing self-research or interested in getting started with personal science and are always happy to welcome student interns in our lab [(more...)](/getinvolved).
