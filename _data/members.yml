  description: Bastian is the team leader of the Peer-Produced Research Lab. He started his career as a biologist and bioinformatician before his interests in open science led him to do research on co-creation in community/citizen science. In 2011, he co-founded openSNP – an open, crowdsourced repository for personal genomics data which has become one of the largest of its kind. Since 2017 he is also the Director of Research for the Open Humans Foundation, which runs a web platform to empower individuals and communities to access and understand their personal data and help them do and share things with it. Bastian is particularly interested in how peer-production ideals can be implemented to support scaling up Quantified Self/Personal Science projects to take them from the n=1 to collective endeavours.

  description: Clara is a bioinformatics M2 student at CRI. She started working in the videogame industry in around 2008. As a lead game designer, creative director, writer and programmer, she directed several projects before switching to medical science in 2018. A transactivist, she joined the Peer-Produced Research Lab in 2020 as part of the <i>Transbiome</i> project she initiated. Even though she doesn’t work in the videogame industry anymore, she is still very enthusiastic about systems and never stops to find bridges between biology and videogames.
