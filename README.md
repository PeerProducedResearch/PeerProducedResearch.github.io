# PeerProducedResearch.github.io
This repository contains (mainly*) the content of the website of the Peer-Produced Research Lab.

For the design, it uses this template: https://github.com/PeerProducedResearch/jekyll-theme-labwebsite 

Currently, for development, the theme is accessed via a local path. To run this page, please download this repository as well as the theme repository and put them in the same parent folder.
To preview locally, you need to install jekyll (https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll).
