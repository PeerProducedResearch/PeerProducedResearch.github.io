# PeerProducedResearch.github.io
This repository contains (mainly*) the content of the website of the Peer-Produced Research Lab.

For the design, it uses this template: https://github.com/PeerProducedResearch/jekyll-theme-labwebsite 

* styles for the header, footer and default layout are in the template. However, styles of the content are currently in the content pages themselves.

## Adapting the website and theme locally
Please download this repository as well as the theme repository and put them in the same parent folder. 

In the _config.yml file, please uncomment "theme: jekyll-theme-labwebsite" and comment out "remote-theme: PeerProducedResearch/jekyll-theme-labwebsite".
In this way, the local copy of the theme will be accessed instead of the version hosted on github.

To preview locally, you need to install jekyll (https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll).
